## Boom

## 4th April, 2015

Add some nice sound effects.

## 22nd Mar, 2015

Add some interfaces that guide users after a game.

## 21st Mar, 2015

Reduce window size, also fix a minor bug which character can move a little more to the left limit of the window.

## 15th Mar, 2015

Fix the bug where extra explode buff doesn't make much sense. Also, player now only can break 1 wall in the same row, which
means you cannot break 2 consecutive wall (one after the other) even if your bombs are powerful enough.

## 1st Mar, 2015

Add door sprite and key sprite. Whenever a player found a key, he/she can eat the key and then has the
permission to open the door of victory. To open the door, player must stand before the door and have the key 
of course. After the door is open, the player can move in to actually win the game.

## 26th Feb, 2015

Code the template of the map and complete the story of the game. Each of the player try to find a key
that gives them the permission to open the door. Who is able to open the door first is the winner.

## 24th Feb, 2015

Add the ability to create multiple monster at a time, and each of them comes out once
a time in nice way. Also, when the monster dies, a nice sprite is displayed.

## 23rd Feb, 2015

Player now can use bombs to kill monsters. Also, the bomb now cannot be moved through.
The issue that when player leave the bomb, the bom travels along as the player is now fixed.

## 22nd Feb, 2015

Give the player some immortal time after the dead (by monsters or bombs).

## 21st Feb, 2015

Add some stunning monster sprites running around the map, and when the player jump in one of
those monsters, a live is deducted. 

## 19th Feb, 2015

Update explosion sprite.

## 18th Feb, 2015

Update wall sprite and the stone sprite denoting an extra explode buff.

## 17th Feb, 2015

Update character sprites and the heart sprite denoting an extra live buff. Now the game has 2
characters for players to choose, male character and female character.

## 14th Feb, 2015

Add the ability to get the buff by blow up the treasure and then eat them. The buffs include extra lives and 
extra explode (which makes the bomb now explodes broader).

## 8th Feb, 2015

Add stunning bomb sprite and some nice animations indicating that the bomb is timing and choose wisely where to
stand :P Big improvement, thanks to Tran Duy Hung.

## 4th Feb, 2015

Add the ability that when a character drop a bomb near a treasure, the bomb will reveal what is inside the treasure.
Also, for UI improvement, an information bar is added separately with the game to indicate essential information for 
the player.

## 3rd Feb, 2015

Add some sprites to the world map and the condition that the character cannot go through these sprites. 
About technical details, a Map object is created to simplify the code and keep track of every sprite in 
the world map. 

## 31th Jan, 2015

Add some game logics like characters now can't escape the screen and when a character is near a bomb
explosion, 1 live is deducted. When the live is zero, the game resets the live to 3 and play some blink 
animations. The other thing is the improvement of the control, player now can press the keys to perform 
continuous movement instead of 1 at a time like before.

## 28th Jan, 2015

Add the world background and the ability to drop a bomb. Big day! 

## 25th Jan, 2015
