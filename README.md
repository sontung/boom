## Boom

## 14th Feb, 2015

Adding the ability to get the buff by blow up the treasure and then eat them. The buffs include extra lives and 
extra explode (which makes the bomb now explodes broader).

## 8th Feb, 2015

Adding stunning bomb sprite and some nice animations indicating that the bomb is timing and choose wisely where to
stand :P Big improvement, thanks to Tran Duy Hung.

## 4th Feb, 2015

Adding the ability that when a character drop a bomb near a treasure, the bomb will reveal what is inside the treasure.
Also, for UI improvement, an information bar is added separately with the game to indicate essential information for 
the player.

## 3rd Feb, 2015

Adding some sprites to the world map and the condition that the character cannot go through these sprites. 
About technical details, a Map object is created to simplify the code and keep track of every sprite in 
the world map. 

## 31th Jan, 2015

Adding some game logics like characters now can't escape the screen and when a character is near a bomb
explosion, 1 live is deducted. When the live is zero, the game resets the live to 3 and play some blink 
animations. The other thing is the improvement of the control, player now can press the keys to perform 
continuous movement instead of 1 at a time like before.
